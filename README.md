The client required a CLI management app to log and track orders for a café that delivers food and drinks to nearby customers. 

The app allows for the following:
Item Availability 
The branch Manager can declare which items are currently available and edit product availability as required.
Manage and Accept Orders
 Whenever a customer orders something, the order request can be put into a system and assign a courier.
Courier Register
The manager can also create and delete courier profile 
Update  Delivery Status
The previous order entry can be updated and will be waiting for the courier to pick up and deliver. 

* The client required a system that stores  products, couriers and orders, and modify/view them using basic CRUD operations.
* The client wants this data to be persisted such that all changes made in prior sessions are maintained.
* The order wants all of the persisted data to be loaded upon start-up.
* The client requires a robust, well-tested app.
* The client wants the app to have frequent updates.

The client’s requirements were fulfilled by focusing on specific requirements on a weekly basis and gradually improve my program to reflect every aspect of of the client specification. Being an absolute beginner in python, this meant I had time to improve on my knowledge and create a robust program.
